For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.

1. Arithmetic Operators:

Addition: 2 + 3 // Result: 5
5.5 + 4.5 // Result: 10
Subtraction: 7 - 5 // Result: 2
10.5 - 2.5 // Result: 8
Multiplication: 3 * 4 // Result: 12
2.5 * 2 // Result: 5
Division: 10 / 2 // Result: 5
8 / 3 // Result: 2.6666666666666665
Remainder: 10 % 3 // Result: 1
13 % 5 // Result: 3
Increment: let i = 0; i++; // Result: 1
let j = 5; j++; // Result: 6
Decrement: let x = 5; x--; // Result: 4
let y = 10; y--; // Result: 9

2. Assignment Operators:
Assignment: let x = 10; // x is assigned the value 10
Addition assignment: let x = 5; x += 3; // Result: x is assigned the value 8
Subtraction assignment: let y = 10; y -= 2; // Result: y is assigned the value 8
Multiplication assignment: let z = 3; z *= 4; // Result: z is assigned the value 12
Division assignment: let a = 12; a /= 3; // Result: a is assigned the value 4
Remainder assignment: let b = 10; b %= 3; // Result: b is assigned the value 1
Left shift assignment: let c = 1; c <<= 3; // Result: c is assigned the value 8
Right shift assignment: let d = 16; d >>= 2; // Result: d is assigned the value 4
Unsigned right shift assignment: let e = -16; e >>>= 2; // Result: e is assigned the value 1073741822
Bitwise AND assignment: let f = 5; f &= 3; // Result: f is assigned the value 1
Bitwise OR assignment: let g = 5; g |= 3; // Result: g is assigned the value 7
Bitwise XOR assignment: let h = 5; h ^= 3; // Result: h is assigned the value 6

3. Comparison Operators:
Equal to: 5 == 5 // Result: true
"5" == 5 // Result: true
Not equal to: 5 != 3 // Result: true
5 != "5" // Result: false
Strict equal to: 5 === 5 // Result: true
"5" === 5 // Result: false
Strict not equal to: 5 !== 3 // Result: true
5 !== "5" // Result: true
Greater than: 5 > 3 // Result: true
"5" > 3 // Result: true
Less than: 5 < 3 // Result: false
"5" < 3 // Result: false
Greater than or equal to: 5 >= 5 // Result: true
"5" >= 5 // Result: true
Less than or equal to: 5 <= 3 // Result
